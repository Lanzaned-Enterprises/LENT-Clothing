# LENT-Clothing
*Resource that can be used along side qb-clothing. The reason for this is actually pretty simple.*

## Dependencies
*There isn't really any the event that will be executed is customizable.*

## Why LENT-Clothing?
*I had noticed that some objects can't be targeted. This will just check the players location take a margin of 20studs and give them the clothing options. What I mean by can't be targeted is actually relitivly simple. You could create a zone but no matter what you tried the eye would never work on it as if it wasn't a targatable object. This helps prevent that and still allows the user to have clothing locations everywhere.*
